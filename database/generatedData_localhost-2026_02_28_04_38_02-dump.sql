To facilitate browsing and organization for customers, all books are systematically grouped into various categories. A category, such as 'Fiction', 'Science', or 'Cooking', is more than just a label; it has its own unique name and a descriptive text that explains the general type of books it encompasses. For example, the 'Fiction' category might be described as 'Engaging stories across various genres and styles,' while 'Science' could be 'Non-fiction works exploring scientific principles and discoveries.' Every single book in the inventory must belong to precisely one category. Conversely, a single category can encompass many different books within it.\\n\\nCustomers are integral to the system. Every customer must have a unique customer identification number, their full name, and an email address for communication. These customers utilize the online platform to place orders for books. When a customer successfully places an order, the system automatically records a unique order number along with the exact date the order was created.\\n\\nAn order can encompass one or more books.

Empirical studies show that novice modellers often:\n                - Concentrate on the main task or main objects, but ignore important secondary concepts,\n                - Fail to identify all required classes or relationships in the domain,\n                - Overlook contextual information and edge cases mentioned in the problem description,\n                - Violate basic object-oriented design principles, resulting in incomplete or low-quality models.\n                \n                For example, in scenarios involving moving objects, students may ignore interactions such as collisions or boundary conditions; in more complex domains, they may omit classes that are essential for representing the full behaviour of the system.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - A correct UML class diagram requires considering multiple aspects of the scenario, not just a single main task,\n                - The text explicitly contains secondary requirements or conditions that are easy to overlook but important for a complete model,\n                - A typical novice solution would miss at least one important class, relationship, or constraint because the student focused only on the core functionality,\n                - A high-quality solution integrates all mentioned aspects into a coherent set of classes and relationships.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing students' ability to interpret the problem from a holistic perspective and to identify all relevant elements of the domain when constructing a UML class diagram.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

The system needs to accurately track all customer interactions, product information, orders, and payment processes. Your task is to design a foundational UML class diagram that captures the core structural elements of this system.\\n\\nEvery customer registered with Sweet Delights provides essential contact details, including their full name and a unique email address for communication. For order processing, each customer must have a primary billing address and can specify one or more shipping addresses. Each address, whether for billing or shipping purposes, is composed of a detailed street name and number, city, postal code, and the country. The system must be able to associate these addresses clearly with the customer and distinguish their specific purpose for order processing and invoicing.\\n\\nThe bakery offers a diverse range of products, such as artisan breads, custom cakes, and seasonal pastries. Each product is uniquely identified by a product ID, has a descriptive name, a detailed textual description, its current unit price, and the quantity currently available in stock. To enhance browsing and inventory management, all products are organized into specific product categories. Each product category itself has a distinct name, like 'Cakes' or 'Gluten-Free', along with a brief description of the types of items it encompasses. The system should be able to list all products within a given category.\\n\\nWhen a customer decides to make a purchase, they create an order. Each order is assigned a unique order number, records the date it was placed, and can optionally include a requested delivery date. An order typically comprises multiple order items, with each item specifying the quantity of a particular product and the unit price of that product at the time the order was placed. It is crucial that every order contains at least one item.\\n\\nFinally, the system needs to manage payments for these orders. An order might be settled with a single payment, or it could involve multiple payment transactions, for example, if a customer makes a partial payment or if an initial payment attempt fails and is retried. Every payment record must capture a unique transaction identifier, the specific amount paid, the exact date and time it was processed, the payment method used (e.g., 'Credit Card', 'PayPal'), and its current processing status (e.g., 'Completed', 'Pending', 'Failed'). This detailed transaction history is vital for accurate financial tracking and customer service, allowing quick retrieval of all payments associated with an order.\\n\\nBased on the scenario described, create a UML Class Diagram.

It is also perfectly normal for a member to have no books currently borrowed, perhaps if they have just returned everything or haven't found anything they wish to read yet.\\n\\nRegarding the `Book`s themselves, at any specific moment, a physical book can be in one of two states related to borrowing: it's either available on the shelves or it's currently checked out by one of the library members. A single book can never be simultaneously borrowed by more than one member. However, over time, the same physical book will be borrowed by many different members as it circulates within the community.

When a visitor registers, the library wants to record which specific event they signed up for. The librarian also mentions that sometimes different events share the same category, and they plan to expand the list of categories over time. Although some beginners might just store a category as a simple text field, the librarian emphasises that categories themselves need to be managed, edited, and possibly deactivated in the future.

Focus on identifying the classes needed to represent events, visitors, registrations, and the concept of event categories.

Empirical studies show that novice modellers often:\n                - Concentrate on the main task or main objects, but ignore important secondary concepts,\n                - Fail to identify all required classes or relationships in the domain,\n                - Overlook contextual information and edge cases mentioned in the problem description,\n                - Violate basic object-oriented design principles, resulting in incomplete or low-quality models.\n                \n                For example, in scenarios involving moving objects, students may ignore interactions such as collisions or boundary conditions; in more complex domains, they may omit classes that are essential for representing the full behaviour of the system.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - A correct UML class diagram requires considering multiple aspects of the scenario, not just a single main task,\n                - The text explicitly contains secondary requirements or conditions that are easy to overlook but important for a complete model,\n                - A typical novice solution would miss at least one important class, relationship, or constraint because the student focused only on the core functionality,\n                - A high-quality solution integrates all mentioned aspects into a coherent set of classes and relationships.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing students' ability to interpret the problem from a holistic perspective and to identify all relevant elements of the domain when constructing a UML class diagram.\n\n             \n\n \n                You must keep the problem description SHORT:\n                    - Approximately 3–5 sentences,\n                    - Focus on essential domain concepts and relationships,\n                    - Avoid unnecessary narrative details.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

This platform aims to offer a variety of educational content to students worldwide. Your goal is to create a UML class diagram that represents the key entities and their relationships within this system.\\n\\nAt the heart of KnowledgeHub are its **Courses**. Every Course has a unique title, a detailed description, and a specified duration (e.g., in weeks or hours). Each Course is meticulously designed and delivered by a dedicated **Instructor**. While a Course is always associated with exactly one Instructor, a single Instructor might be responsible for teaching multiple different Courses, or perhaps none if they are new to the platform. The system needs to keep track of the Instructor's name, email, and a brief biography.\\n\\n**Students** are the primary users of the platform. Each Student has a unique student ID, a name, and an email address. Students can enroll in various Courses. When a Student enrolls in a Course, an **Enrollment Record** is created. This record captures specific details like the date of enrollment, and potentially a completion date and a grade once the student finishes the Course. A Student can have many Enrollment Records, corresponding to all the courses they have ever joined. Similarly, a Course can have many Students enrolled, each represented by their own Enrollment Record.\\n\\nTo ensure structured learning, every Course is broken down into one or more **Modules**. Each Module has a title and an order number to define its sequence within the Course. A Module cannot exist independently; it is always part of exactly one Course. Furthermore, within each Module, there are one or more **Lessons**. Each Lesson has a title, a textual description of its content, and an estimated duration in minutes. A Lesson is always part of exactly one Module.\\n\\nFinally, Lessons often include supplementary **Learning Resources** to enhance the learning experience. These resources could be anything from video files, PDF documents, external web links, or interactive exercises.

A class should encapsulate the essential attributes and behaviors that are relevant for the software system. Empirical studies show that many students struggle to assign appropriate behavior to classes. Typical problems include:\n                - Methods that do not correspond to the underlying concept of the class,\n                - Overloaded classes with many unrelated methods and low cohesion,\n                - Classes without any meaningful behavior (only attributes and trivial getters/setters),\n                - Misplaced behavior that conceptually belongs to another class.\n                \n                For example, students might:\n                - Add a moveFurniture() method to a Room class,\n                - Attach payment- or registration-related methods to a Bet class instead of a dedicated Payment or Registration class,\n                - Define classes with only get() and set() methods and no domain-specific operations.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - Correct assignment of behavior (methods) to classes is crucial for a good solution,\n                - At least one class in the intended solution clearly requires cohesive, domain-relevant methods,\n                - The scenario naturally invites the typical student error of either overloading a class with unrelated methods or assigning behavior to the wrong class,\n                - A reasonable solution requires students to think about abstraction and responsibility distribution between classes.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing the proper assignment of behavior to classes in UML class diagrams.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

The center updates these themes occasionally, and each theme has its own description, recommended duration range, and a list of safety considerations that apply to all workshops under it.

When registering, participants may express preferences, such as whether they want beginner-friendly instructions or whether they require material assistance. The center tracks these preferences per registration rather than per participant, because they can change from one workshop to another. Each workshop may require specific material packs that include items such as paint sets, seed kits, or electronic components, and each pack type must be described with its own name, content summary, and restocking instructions. Some workshops need multiple different pack types.

Each event is organised by exactly one staff member, who is responsible for planning its schedule and inviting guests. A staff member can organise several events during a year, depending on their workload. Events always take place at one branch of the library, and each branch can host multiple events, sometimes even on the same day. The library also manages a pool of external speakers who may be invited to events. A speaker may be invited to multiple events, and an event may feature several speakers, although a few events have none if they are internally run workshops. Every event requires a registration process in which attendees sign up. An attendee may register for multiple events, and most events have many attendees. Each registration records the date of sign-up and the attendee’s chosen participation type, such as on-site or remote. All branches have a branch manager, and every manager is also a staff member, but only one manager is assigned per branch. Some events are categorised as children’s activities, while others are adult programmes, creating two types of events that share many features but differ slightly in their requirements.

A class should encapsulate the essential attributes and behaviors that are relevant for the software system. Empirical studies show that many students struggle to assign appropriate behavior to classes. Typical problems include:\n                - Methods that do not correspond to the underlying concept of the class,\n                - Overloaded classes with many unrelated methods and low cohesion,\n                - Classes without any meaningful behavior (only attributes and trivial getters/setters),\n                - Misplaced behavior that conceptually belongs to another class.\n                \n                For example, students might:\n                - Add a moveFurniture() method to a Room class,\n                - Attach payment- or registration-related methods to a Bet class instead of a dedicated Payment or Registration class,\n                - Define classes with only get() and set() methods and no domain-specific operations.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - Correct assignment of behavior (methods) to classes is crucial for a good solution,\n                - At least one class in the intended solution clearly requires cohesive, domain-relevant methods,\n                - The scenario naturally invites the typical student error of either overloading a class with unrelated methods or assigning behavior to the wrong class,\n                - A reasonable solution requires students to think about abstraction and responsibility distribution between classes.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing the proper assignment of behavior to classes in UML class diagrams.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

Instructors may supervise multiple workshops over time, and each instructor maintains a personal profile that lists their skills and availability periods. Participants may register for workshops, cancel their registrations, or join a waiting list if a workshop has reached its capacity. The community centre wants the software to record not only who is registered but also when the registration occurred, because late registrations may require special handling by the staff. In addition, some workshops require equipment kits that must be assembled in advance from several distinct components stored in the centre’s supply room. A kit is composed of multiple components, each with a stock quantity and a restock threshold that the supply manager must monitor. To support smooth operations, the system should allow staff members to trigger the assembly of equipment kits only when enough components are available, and they should be able to update stock levels after restocking deliveries. Staff members also need a way to mark a workshop session as completed and record brief notes about issues encountered, such as missing equipment or schedule delays. The community centre has emphasised that different responsibilities should not be bundled into a single overly general class. For example, workshop scheduling, participant management, and inventory handling should remain conceptually distinct, even though they interact. Students are asked to create a UML class diagram that captures these elements, including suitable behaviors for the major domain classes, so that each class supports the operations logically associated with its responsibilities.

Empirical studies show that novice modellers often:\n                - Collapse rich concepts into a single attribute (e.g., a "type" attribute instead of a dedicated class),\n                - Misassign attributes to the wrong class,\n                - Omit important attributes or related classes altogether,\n                - Think primarily in terms of data fields rather than object abstractions and responsibilities.\n                \n                Examples include:\n                - Using an attribute "type" or "typeOfBet" instead of a separate BetType class,\n                - Assigning salary calculation directly to an Employee class instead of modelling a HumanResources or Payroll class,\n                - Treating complex concepts as mere data fields instead of identifying them as entities with their own attributes and behavior.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - The domain contains at least one concept that clearly deserves to be modelled as a separate class rather than as a simple attribute,\n                - A typical novice solution would be tempted to represent this concept as a single attribute on another class,\n                - A better solution recognises the need for a dedicated class with its own attributes and behavior,\n                - Students must think about the abstraction level and decide which concepts in the scenario should become classes.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing the correct identification of classes versus mere attributes in UML class diagrams.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

The platform supports events such as conferences, concerts, and trade fairs, each of which can span multiple days and occupy different sections of the venue at different times. Event organisers must specify not only the title and purpose of each event but also a detailed configuration of the event’s setup style, such as theatre seating, banquet layout, or modular booth arrangements. These setup styles vary widely across events and have properties such as minimum required floor space, compatible equipment categories, and typical preparation duration. A novice designer might be tempted to store an event’s setup style merely as a single text attribute, but the venue management team frequently reuses and customises these styles, treating them as reusable, parameterised design templates that must be represented in the system. Each event may require multiple resources, including equipment, staff teams, and temporary structures. Equipment resources have their own lifecycles and usage constraints, and the platform must track when specific items are booked, prepared, or under maintenance. Staff teams are specialised (for example, lighting, security, staging, cleaning) and can serve multiple events but must not be scheduled for overlapping time slots. The venue contains multiple areas, and some areas contain subareas with stricter regulations; for example, a subarea may ban pyrotechnics even if the containing area allows it, and these rules must be respected when selecting equipment for an event. External service providers, such as catering companies or audio engineering firms, may also be contracted for specific event segments, and each provider communicates service specifications that may include pricing models, delivery conditions, and setup dependencies. Some services depend on others, creating cross-event or intra-event ordering constraints. The system must ensure that any event configuration respects all area rules, equipment availability, staffing constraints, and service dependencies. You must create a UML class diagram that captures the essential classes, their relationships, inheritance structures where appropriate, compositions or aggregations, and all relevant constraints arising from the narrative. Where ambiguities occur, you must make justified modelling decisions, especially regarding which concepts deserve dedicated classes rather than being treated as mere attributes. The scenario contains multiple concepts that might initially seem like attributes but must be modelled as full-fledged classes, such as setup styles, equipment categories, regulatory constraints, and service specifications.",\n  "uml_requirements": {\n    "must_include": [\n      "At least one inheritance hierarchy for different kinds of resources (for example, equipment and staff teams).",\n      "At least one aggregation or composition relationship involving venue areas and their subareas.",\n      "Explicit modelling of event setup styles as their own class rather than as a simple attribute on an event.",\n      "At least one constraint expressing non-overlapping staff scheduling or equipment availability.",\n      "Representation of service specifications as a dedicated class with associations to events or event segments."\n    ],\n    "common_misconceptions_to_trigger": [\n      "Students might incorrectly model setup style as a single attribute rather than a class with its own attributes.",\n      "Students may collapse equipment categories or service specifications into text fields instead of modelling them as entities.",\n      "Students might omit critical constraints such as non-overlapping staff assignments.",\n      "Students may incorrectly represent subareas as simple attributes of areas instead of using composition."\n    ]\n  }\n}	2026-02-23 20:01:17.39252	2026-02-23 20:01:17.392526

Event registrations may be cancelled or modified, but changes must remain consistent with both group‑level and individual‑level restrictions, and it is left intentionally unclear whether these modifications apply per Participant, per Group, or per Event.

Workshops can have multiple scheduled sessions, and participants register for specific sessions rather than for the workshop as a whole. Every session is held in a single room, although rooms may host multiple different workshops on different days. Some workshops require specialised equipment sets, such as soldering kits or woodworking tools, and each equipment set is composed of multiple individual pieces that must be tracked individually. The centre keeps records of the condition status of each piece of equipment, including when it was last inspected, and some equipment pieces require a safety clearance for use. Participants who wish to attend sessions involving restricted equipment must hold a valid clearance, which expires after a certain date. Instructors are responsible not only for teaching the workshop but also for confirming that any required equipment is both available and functional before a session begins. When a piece of equipment is damaged during a session, the instructor must file a damage report that includes details about what happened and which participant was using the item at the time, if applicable. The centre also maintains information about room capacity, and sessions cannot exceed the room’s maximum occupancy. Occasionally, sessions are cancelled or rescheduled, and when this happens, all registered participants must be notified through a communication record.

Every resident who participates in the platform can act as both a learner and an instructor, although some choose to play only one of these roles. Residents register with a profile that may list multiple skills they are willing to teach, but they may also join the platform without listing any skills initially. Each skill has a name and a descriptive category, and different residents may teach the same type of skill in different styles or at different levels. A learning session is proposed by exactly one resident acting as the instructor and may attract any number of learners, but some sessions end up canceled if no learners register in time. Sessions take place at community venues, and a single venue can host several sessions, even simultaneously, as long as rooms do not conflict. The council manages multiple venues around the city, each with several rooms, but some rooms cannot be booked for certain kinds of skills due to equipment constraints. Each booking links one specific session to exactly one room, but a room may host zero or many sessions in a given week. The system must allow residents to leave feedback on sessions they attended, though feedback is optional and must always refer to exactly one session. A session cannot receive feedback from anyone who did not attend it, but learners may submit multiple feedback entries across different sessions. The council also tracks equipment sets assigned to each room; equipment sets may be shared across rooms or reassigned, but each set must belong to at least one room at any given time. Some session types require exclusive equipment sets, while others can run without any equipment at all, creating possible ambiguities about how to link skills, equipment, and rooms.

The centre employs instructors with different expertise levels, and some instructors act as mentors who can supervise other instructors, although not all instructors have this role. Participants can register for workshops, but a participant may also request personalised materials in advance, which must be approved or rejected by an instructor based on availability and safety considerations. The centre wants the system to automatically generate preparation checklists for each session, but instructors must be able to add custom items or validate items that the system proposes. Workshops are held in different rooms, some of which are shared between several sessions on the same day, requiring the system to ensure there is no conflicting use of equipment. Certain types of workshops are categorised into thematic groups, where groups may form larger clusters (for example, all technical workshops forming one cluster). These thematic relationships change over time, and the platform must maintain historical records of these changes. The centre also wants to track instructor performance reports, which are periodically created by mentors. A report may reference multiple sessions and must include qualitative assessments submitted separately by participants. Some assessments are optional while others become mandatory if the session involved heavy equipment. The platform must also produce summary overviews for annual audits, but these should not be modelled as a single class; instead, the underlying data structures must support generating such summaries. You must create a UML class diagram that captures this scenario, including appropriate abstractions, relationships, constraints, and behavioural responsibilities.

Empirical studies show that novice modellers often:\n                - Concentrate on the main task or main objects, but ignore important secondary concepts,\n                - Fail to identify all required classes or relationships in the domain,\n                - Overlook contextual information and edge cases mentioned in the problem description,\n                - Violate basic object-oriented design principles, resulting in incomplete or low-quality models.\n                \n                For example, in scenarios involving moving objects, students may ignore interactions such as collisions or boundary conditions; in more complex domains, they may omit classes that are essential for representing the full behaviour of the system.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - A correct UML class diagram requires considering multiple aspects of the scenario, not just a single main task,\n                - The text explicitly contains secondary requirements or conditions that are easy to overlook but important for a complete model,\n                - A typical novice solution would miss at least one important class, relationship, or constraint because the student focused only on the core functionality,\n                - A high-quality solution integrates all mentioned aspects into a coherent set of classes and relationships.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing students' ability to interpret the problem from a holistic perspective and to identify all relevant elements of the domain when constructing a UML class diagram.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

The primary function, of course, revolves around managing its vast collection of books and allowing registered patrons to borrow them. Each book is uniquely identified by its ISBN and has a title, author, and publication year; crucially, the library tracks individual physical copies, each with its own unique identifier. Patrons, who can be students, faculty, or staff, are identified by a unique ID, have a name and contact information, and are registered at a specific library branch when they join.\\n\\nWhen a patron wishes to borrow a book, a loan record is created, noting the date of borrowing and the due date. Upon return, the return date is recorded. It's important to keep track of all past and current loans for each patron and each physical book copy. A significant challenge for the library is managing overdue items. When a book is returned past its due date, a fine is automatically incurred. Each fine has an associated amount, an issue date, and its payment status must be tracked. Every fine is directly linked back to the specific loan that generated it.\\n\\nBeyond books, the university library also provides various study facilities. Each library branch contains several study rooms, which can vary in capacity and may include special features like projectors or whiteboards. These study rooms are a valuable resource that patrons can reserve. To manage this, a booking system is needed: patrons can make multiple bookings for a study room, specifying a particular date and time slot and a duration. Each booking must be associated with the patron who made it and the specific study room being reserved.\\n\\nFinally, the entire system operates across several distinct physical library branches. Each branch has a unique name and address. Each physical book copy belongs exclusively to one specific library branch, and similarly, each study room is permanently located within a single branch. While patrons are registered at one home branch, they may interact with resources (e.g., borrow books or book rooms) from any branch, though for the purpose of this initial model, we only need to track their primary registration branch.

The platform aims to provide a structured learning experience, allowing students to acquire new skills at their own pace and instructors to share their expertise. This system facilitates the creation, delivery, and tracking of educational content.\\n\\nEvery individual who interacts with SkillSphere, whether for learning or teaching, is considered a registered platform user. Students are the primary learners; they actively seek to enroll in and complete courses, track their personal learning progress, and ultimately gain recognition for their achievements. Instructors, on the other hand, are the content creators and educators. They are responsible for developing new courses, managing their content, and guiding students through the learning process by responding to queries.\\n\\nA 'Course' on SkillSphere is a structured educational program, defined by a unique title, a brief description, and a specific price. Each course is composed of several 'Lesson's, which are the fundamental units of learning. A lesson typically includes various types of educational material such as video content, reading materials, or interactive exercises. It is essential that a course cannot exist without at least one associated lesson. Lessons have their own title and a content URL pointing to the actual learning material.\\n\\nStudents can browse available courses and choose to enroll in them. Upon successful enrollment, a student begins their learning journey for that specific course. For each course a student is enrolled in, their progress is meticulously tracked, indicating which lessons they have completed. Students should be able to complete lessons one by one, marking them as finished as they progress. Additionally, students might need to answer 'Quiz'es that are associated with specific lessons to test their understanding and solidify their knowledge.\\n\\nInstructors have the capability to create new courses on the platform, publish them to make them available to students, and update existing course details or lesson content as needed. They also need to be able to manage the quizzes associated with their lessons, potentially adding new questions or updating existing ones. When a student successfully completes all lessons and any required quizzes within a course, they are eligible to receive a 'Certificate' of completion, which officially confirms their achievement. This certificate should be verifiable through the platform.\\n\\nThe system needs to manage these entities and their interactions efficiently. Your task is to design a UML class diagram that models the core components of the SkillSphere platform. Focus on identifying the key classes, their relevant attributes, and the relationships between them, including appropriate multiplicities. Crucially, think about what responsibilities (methods) each class should encapsulate to ensure a well-organized and maintainable system.

no inheritance; no aggregation/composition   \n        - 1: Includes either inheritance or aggregation/composition   \n        - 2: Includes inheritance and aggregation/composition, or requires role names / navigability decisions\n        \n        3)Constraints & precision:   \n        - 0: Only basic multiplicities   \n        - 1: Multiple multiplicities plus at least one special case (optional/mandatory edge case)   \n        - 2: Explicit constraints (OCL-like rules) or cross-cutting consistency constraints\n        \n        4)Ambiguity in the text:   \n        - 0: Fully unambiguous requirements   \n        - 1: Exactly one minor ambiguity, resolvable without extra assumptions   \n        - 2: Multiple plausible modelling variants;

The platform allows users to meticulously select from a vast array of components, configure their ideal machine, and then proceed to place orders. \\n\\nUpon registering, a customer's essential information, such as their unique `customer ID`, `full name`, and `email address`, is securely stored. Customers are encouraged to maintain multiple `shipping addresses` within their profile; each address is uniquely identified by a `descriptive label` (e.g., 'Home', 'Work', 'Vacation Spot') and comprises standard details like `street name`, `house number`, `city`, `postal code`, and `country`. While a customer can have many addresses, any specific order is shipped to only one designated address. \\n\\nThe core of the Quantum Builds system revolves around the extensive catalog of `components` available for PC assembly. Every component is characterized by a unique `model name`, its `manufacturer`, a `base price`, and a `brief description`. More specialized properties exist depending on the component's category: for instance, `CPUs` have a `socket type` and `core count`, `GPUs` feature `video memory size` and an `interface type`, and `Motherboards` possess a `socket type`, a `chipset model`, and a specific number of `RAM slots`. Each `component` is supplied by exactly one `manufacturer`, which itself has a `name` and `country of origin`. \\n\\nCustomers construct `custom PC configurations` by carefully selecting a set of compatible components. A valid `configuration` must always include exactly one `motherboard`, one `CPU`, one `power supply unit`, and one `PC case`. Additionally, it can optionally incorporate one or more `graphics processing units (GPUs)`, one or more `RAM modules`, and one or more `storage devices` (like SSDs or HDDs). A paramount aspect of the system is `component compatibility`: for example, a selected `CPU` must be compatible with the `socket type` of the chosen `motherboard`. Similarly, the `RAM modules` must match the `RAM slot type` and `maximum capacity` supported by the `motherboard`. These compatibility checks are not simple attribute comparisons but involve complex rule sets and interdependencies between various component specifications. It is crucial to model these intricate relationships rather than treating compatibility as a mere flag or text field.\\n\\nOnce a customer finalizes a `configuration`, they can proceed to place an `order`. Each order is assigned a unique `order number`, records the `order date`, tracks its current `status` (e.g., 'Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled'), and computes a `total amount`. An order is always initiated by a single `customer` and is directed to one specific `shipping address` chosen from the customer's saved addresses. An order comprises one or more `order items`, where each item quantifies a particular `custom PC configuration` at the `price point` valid at the time the order was placed. \\n\\nCustomers have several `payment methods` at their disposal. Options include `credit card` payments (requiring `card number`, `expiration date`, and `cardholder name`), `PayPal` (identified by a `PayPal account email`), or a `bank transfer` (requiring `bank name`, `account number`, and `SWIFT/BIC code`). An order's processing cannot advance until payment has been successfully authorized or completed. \\n\\nShipping operations are handled by various `shipping services` (e.g., 'Standard Ground', 'Express Air'). Each service has a `name`, an `estimated delivery time range`, and its own `cost calculation rules`. After an order is dispatched, one or more `shipping events` might be recorded for it, each event capturing a `tracking number`, the `actual shipping date`, and the `delivery date`. If a component in a configuration has a `serial number`, this unique identifier is tracked specifically for that component within the context of an `order item` rather than as a general property of the component type itself. \\n\\nYour task is to create a UML Class Diagram that accurately models the domain described above for the 'Quantum Builds' system. Ensure your diagram clearly represents classes, their attributes, and all specified relationships, including multiplicities, inheritance, aggregation, and composition where appropriate. Pay close attention to distinguishing between concepts that should be modelled as distinct classes with their own responsibilities and those that are better represented as simple attributes.

This system aims to provide real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and comprehensive analysis of urban traffic and related environmental conditions. You are tasked with creating a robust UML class diagram that captures the core static structure of this system's domain.\\n\\nThe urban area is logically partitioned into numerous **Traffic Zones**, each identified by a unique ID and a descriptive name, along with a definition of its geographical boundaries. While zones might conceptually overlap for long-term urban planning or historical data aggregation, the system's real-time traffic management module requires that any specific road segment or point in space be unambiguously assigned to exactly one *primary* Traffic Zone at any given moment. Each zone should also reflect its current traffic congestion status, which is dynamically updated.\\n\\nAcross these zones, an extensive network of **Sensors** is deployed. All sensors share common properties like a unique identifier, their precise geographical coordinates, the date of their installation, and their current operational status (e.g., active, inactive, under maintenance). There are several specialized types of sensors:\\n    *   **Traffic Volume Sensors** are crucial for monitoring vehicle movement, recording the number of vehicles passing a point and their average speed at regular intervals.\\n    *   **Environmental Sensors** focus on urban air quality (e.g., PM2.5, CO2 levels) and noise pollution.\\n    *   **Camera Sensors** are the most advanced, capable of detecting and classifying different **Vehicle Types** (e.g., Car, Bus, Truck, Motorcycle) and identifying unusual events that might indicate a **Traffic Incident**.\\nEach sensor type generates specific kinds of timestamped **Sensor Readings** or events, which must be stored for both real-time analysis and historical logging.\\n\\nTraffic flow is further managed by numerous **Traffic Light Intersections** located throughout the city. Each intersection is uniquely identified and contains multiple individual **Traffic Light Signals**, each controlling traffic for a specific lane or direction. The system must know the current state (Red, Yellow, Green) and the planned duration for each signal. The coordinated operation of these signals at an intersection is governed by a **Traffic Light Program**, which defines a sequence of states and timings for a collection of signals. Several programs might exist for an intersection (e.g., peak hour, off-peak hour, special event).\\n\\nWhen unexpected events occur, such as accidents, road blockages, or severe weather, a **Traffic Incident** is registered. An incident has a unique identifier, a specific type, a detailed description, the time it was reported, and ultimately, its resolution time. An incident often impacts multiple Traffic Zones simultaneously, and its severity must be recorded.\\nThe system also needs to accommodate **Emergency Vehicles** (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks), which have specific priority requirements. When an Emergency Vehicle is en route to an incident or destination, the system needs to be able to temporarily override standard Traffic Light Programs in its path to ensure rapid transit.\\n\\nTo ensure system reliability, a comprehensive **Maintenance Record** system is essential. Any repair, calibration, or routine check performed on a sensor or a traffic light signal must be logged, including the date, a description of the work, and the **Operator** (a human user from the Control Center) who authorized or performed the work. Operators are also responsible for monitoring the system, creating Traffic Incidents manually, and adjusting Traffic Light Programs in response to real-time events.\\n\\nYour task is to create a UML class diagram that effectively models the static structure of this urban mobility domain, capturing all relevant entities, their attributes, and their relationships, including appropriate multiplicities and any critical constraints implied by the description. Pay particular attention to how different aspects of the system interact and how all mentioned details, even those seemingly secondary, are integrated into a coherent model. Consider potential variations in modelling certain aspects and state any assumptions you make to resolve ambiguities.",\n  "uml_requirements": {\n    "must_include": [\n      "At least one inheritance hierarchy (e.g., Sensor and its subclasses).",\n      "At least one composition relationship (e.g., TrafficLightIntersection and TrafficLightSignal).",\n      "Explicit representation of the Emergency Vehicle priority mechanism, showing its interaction with Traffic Light Programs.",\n      "A class for capturing Maintenance Records, associated with the maintainable system components.",\n      "Classes for Operator and VehicleType, with appropriate relationships to other entities.",\n      "A many-to-many association between TrafficIncident and TrafficZone."\n    ],\n    "common_misconceptions_to_trigger": [\n      "Students might omit secondary classes like MaintenanceRecord or Operator, focusing only on the core traffic entities (HOL).",\n      "Students might simplify the TrafficZone definition, neglecting the distinction between overlapping conceptual zones and unambiguous primary zones for real-time management (HOL, Ambiguity).",\n      "Students may fail to model the specific interaction required for Emergency Vehicle priority, instead using a generic association or ignoring it (HOL, Relationship complexity).",\n      "Students might not identify the need for a separate VehicleType class or struggle with how SensorReadings should be structured to capture varied data (HOL, Ambiguity)."\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```	2026-02-24 18:37:18.153556	2026-02-24 18:37:18.153565

Your primary goal is to create a comprehensive UML Class Diagram that accurately reflects the described structure and relationships.\\n\\nFirst, consider the organizational structure: The 'University' is the overarching entity. It is composed of multiple 'Departments', which are integral to the university's existence. Each Department has a unique name, a designated code, and a head, who must always be a 'FacultyMember'.\\n\\nThe university involves various 'People'. Every Person has a name, date of birth, and contact details. There are two main categories of people relevant to this system: 'FacultyMember's and 'Student's. FacultyMembers have an employee ID, an academic rank (e.g., Professor, Lecturer), and a hire date. Each FacultyMember must belong to exactly one primary Department. Students, on the other hand, have a student ID, enrollment date, and current GPA. A Student must always be enrolled in at least one 'DegreeProgram' as their primary major and may optionally declare additional DegreePrograms as minors.\\n\\nFor academic offerings, the university provides numerous 'Course's, each identified by a unique course code, a descriptive title, and a detailed syllabus. Every Course is owned and administered by precisely one Department. Some Courses are structured with 'Prerequisite' relationships, meaning a student must complete certain courses before enrolling in others. A single Course can have multiple prerequisites, and simultaneously, a Course can serve as a prerequisite for multiple different courses. Each academic term, a specific 'CourseOffering' is scheduled for a Course, distinguished by a section number, academic year, semester, and a maximum enrollment capacity. A CourseOffering must always be based on exactly one Course. Crucially, every CourseOffering must be taught by at least one FacultyMember designated as an instructor, and it can be co-taught by several FacultyMembers. A single FacultyMember often teaches multiple CourseOfferings over their career.\\n\\nStudents interact with these offerings by 'enrolling' in 'CourseOffering's. An enrollment record captures details such as the student's final grade and the date of enrollment. A student can enroll in many CourseOfferings throughout their studies, and a CourseOffering typically accommodates many enrolled students. This enrollment record specifically links a student to a single instance of a CourseOffering.\\n\\n'DegreeProgram's (e.g., 'BSc Computer Science', 'Minor in Mathematics') are formally defined with a unique title, an academic level (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's), and total credit requirements. Each DegreeProgram is administered by exactly one Department. Furthermore, a DegreeProgram is systematically defined by a set of 'CurriculumRequirement's. These requirements specify the types or categories of courses students must complete to graduate (e.g., '3 core courses from CS department', '2 electives from any STEM department'). These requirements are an integral part of the program and cease to exist if the program is discontinued.\\n\\nBeyond academics, the university supports extensive 'ResearchProject's. Each ResearchProject has a title, start date, projected end date, and current status. Every ResearchProject must be led by exactly one FacultyMember designated as the 'Principal Investigator' (PI). Additionally, a ResearchProject can involve multiple other FacultyMembers and Students serving as 'research team members'. The outcomes of these projects often lead to 'Publication's. A Publication has a title, publication date, and a type (e.g., Journal Article, Conference Paper, Patent). A Publication can be associated with one or more ResearchProjects that contributed to its content. Every Publication must have at least one 'Author', who can be either a FacultyMember or a Student. An Author can contribute to many Publications over their career.\\n\\nYour task is to create a UML Class Diagram based on this description, clearly identifying all relevant classes, their attributes, all associations with correct multiplicities, and any necessary inheritance, aggregation, or composition relationships.

assumptions must be stated and justified\n        \n        5) Bloom cognitive process level required:   - 0: Remember / understand   - 1: Apply / analyze   - 2: Evaluate / create\n        \n        You must align the exercise with the following overall difficulty level:\n        \n        - EASY: \n            Aim for DI scores mostly 0, with at most one dimension at 1.        \n            The model size and relationship complexity should be low,\n            the text should be unambiguous, and the cognitive demand should be\n            limited to remembering, understanding, and basic application.\n        \n        - MEDIUM: \n            Aim for a mixture of scores 0 and 1, and optionally one dimension at 2.\n            The model should have moderate size and at least one advanced          \n            relationship type (inheritance or aggregation/composition),          \n            with some additional constraints and limited ambiguity.          \n            Students should need to apply and analyse, not just recall.\n            \n        - HARD: \n            Aim for scores mostly 2 across the dimensions.        \n            The model should be large, with multiple advanced relationship types,        \n            explicit constraints or cross-cutting consistency rules,        \n            and controlled ambiguity that requires students to make and justify modelling assumptions.        \n            The task should require evaluating alternatives and creating a coherent model.\n        \n    \n        \n\n You must generate a Hard exercise according to the Difficulty Index. \n        Follow the Hard profile described above.\n         \n\n \n                Study goal (targeted misconception): Classes with inappropriate or insufficient behavior (COM).\n                \n                Explanation:\n                In object-oriented modelling, a class represents an abstraction, while an object is a concrete entity in time and space. A class should encapsulate the essential attributes and behaviors that are relevant for the software system. Empirical studies show that many students struggle to assign appropriate behavior to classes. Typical problems include:\n                - Methods that do not correspond to the underlying concept of the class,\n                - Overloaded classes with many unrelated methods and low cohesion,\n                - Classes without any meaningful behavior (only attributes and trivial getters/setters),\n                - Misplaced behavior that conceptually belongs to another class.\n                \n                For example, students might:\n                - Add a moveFurniture() method to a Room class,\n                - Attach payment- or registration-related methods to a Bet class instead of a dedicated Payment or Registration class,\n                - Define classes with only get() and set() methods and no domain-specific operations.\n                \n                For this exercise, you must design the problem such that:\n                - Correct assignment of behavior (methods) to classes is crucial for a good solution,\n                - At least one class in the intended solution clearly requires cohesive, domain-relevant methods,\n                - The scenario naturally invites the typical student error of either overloading a class with unrelated methods or assigning behavior to the wrong class,\n                - A reasonable solution requires students to think about abstraction and responsibility distribution between classes.\n                \n                Your exercise must therefore explicitly support the study goal of practising and assessing the proper assignment of behavior to classes in UML class diagrams.\n\n             \n\n \n               You must create a LONG problem description:\n                    - More than 10 sentences,\n                    - Include richer narrative context and multiple related situations,\n                    - All details should have potential modelling relevance.\n             \n\n \n    Output format requirements:\n    \n    You must return the generated exercise as a single valid JSON object.\n    Do not include any explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.\n    Do not use trailing commas.

The system needs to support multiple homes, each potentially managed by several users with varying access levels. Each `Home` is comprised of multiple `Room`s, such as 'Living Room', 'Kitchen', or 'Bedroom'. Within each room, various `SmartDevice`s can be installed and operated. These devices fall into several categories: `SmartLight`s (which can be turned on/off and have their brightness adjusted), `SmartThermostat`s (controlling target temperature and operating modes like 'heating' or 'cooling'), and `SmartDoorLock`s (which can be locked or unlocked remotely). Critically, some devices, like thermostats, have integrated `Sensor`s (e.g., temperature sensors), while others might interact with separate, dedicated `Sensor`s (e.g., a motion sensor in a hallway). Each sensor records specific types of data over time, such as temperature readings or motion detection events. The system's core functionality involves allowing `User`s to directly interact with `SmartDevice`s. For example, a user should be able to `turnOn()` a light, `setTargetTemperature()` on a thermostat, or `lock()` a door. Furthermore, the system must support sophisticated `AutomationRule`s. An automation rule defines a `Condition` (e.g., \\"if motion detected in living room AND it's after sunset\\") that, when met, triggers one or more `Action`s (e.g., \\"turn on living room light to 50% brightness\\"). These rules can be scheduled to be active only during specific `TimeInterval`s or perpetually. There are also simple `Schedule`s that execute specific device actions at predefined times, independent of conditions. For instance, a schedule might `turnOff()` all lights at midnight every day. It is paramount that the system correctly manages the state of each device and logs all significant events. A user can only manage devices within homes they are explicitly registered to, and they might have different `Role`s (e.g., 'Owner', 'Guest') affecting their permissions. A device, once assigned to a room, cannot simultaneously belong to another room. The system must also ensure that when an `AutomationRule` is activated, its constituent actions are performed on the correct devices. Consider how the system would `evaluate()` a condition based on sensor input and then `execute()` the associated actions. Think carefully about where the responsibility for `loggingEvents()` or `updatingDeviceState()` should reside, and how an `AutomationRule` truly *operates* rather than just *stores* its configuration. Be particularly mindful of assigning methods that represent actual operations performed by or on an instance of a class, avoiding 'god objects' or classes that are merely data holders. Your task is to develop a UML class diagram that accurately represents this smart home automation system.",\n  "uml_requirements": {\n    "must_include": [\n      "At least one inheritance hierarchy for device types (e.g., SmartDevice and its subclasses).",\n      "At least one composition relationship (e.g., Home containing Rooms, or Room containing SmartDevices).",\n      "Associations with explicit multiplicities (e.g., 1-to-many, many-to-many).",\n      "Classes with domain-specific methods that reflect their responsibilities (e.g., `turnOn()` for `SmartLight`, `setTargetTemperature()` for `SmartThermostat`, `evaluateCondition()` for `AutomationRule`).",\n      "Explicit constraints or notes that capture the stated business rules (e.g., a device belongs to only one room at a time, user permissions).",\n      "Consideration of where `evaluate()` and `execute()` methods related to automation rules should be placed for proper responsibility distribution."\n    ],\n    "common_misconceptions_to_trigger": [\n      "Students might place device control methods (e.g., `turnOnLight()`, `lockDoor()`) on the `Room` or `Home` class instead of the specific device classes.",\n      "Students might define `SmartDevice` subclasses with only attributes and trivial getters/setters, centralizing all control logic in a single 'controller' class.",\n      "Students might fail to model distinct responsibilities for rule evaluation, condition checking, and action execution within the automation logic, treating `AutomationRule` as a passive data structure.",\n      "Students might struggle to distribute behaviors like `loggingEvents()` or `updatingDeviceState()` appropriately across relevant classes, leading to misplaced or absent functionality."\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```	2026-02-24 18:42:42.955899	2026-02-24 18:42:42.955905
